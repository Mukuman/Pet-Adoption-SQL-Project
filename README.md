# Find My Pet

Our project, Find My Pet, aims to assist potential candidates interested in adopting a pet by modelling key aspects of a successful pet adoption agency. It will store valuable information about pets like diets, genetics, nature, vaccinations and games they like to play, and match pets with suitable adopters by setting up appointments.
